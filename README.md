# CadenceWebform
This repo hosts all the files required to create a properly formatted observation request within the KPF Community Cadence program

There are three files:
- twilight_times_2024A.csv -- a csv of the 12 degree evening and morning twilight times for each day in the 2024A semester
- requestSheetFunctions.py -- a python file containing all the functions necessary for building a properly formatted request
- buildProgram.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook containing an example of how to create requests and then properly format them

Download a version of these three files to your local machine, but you will only need to interact with the buildProgram.ipynb file. Using buildProgram.ipynb as an example, follow instructions within the notebook on how to use. When complete, email jblubin@astro.ucla.edu with your program request in a csv file. 

Note: to use this notebook, you must have installed both astropy and astroplan. 

Similarly, reach out to jblubin@astro.ucla.edu with any questions.
