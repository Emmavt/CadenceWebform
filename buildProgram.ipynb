    "There are two classes: Requests and Programs. You will first generate a Request object for each target by instantiating a new Request object and then manually entering information about the target as well as desired observational strategy. Options to pull coordinates from SIMBAD are included, be sure the target name is queriable. **See below for two examples.** Once all information is inputed, you will run 2 functions within the Request object: checkForNones() and runChecks(). These will ensure that all formatting is correct. If there are errors, messages will be outputted to you. Fix all errors and rerun these functions before continuing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optional but encouraged to run computeTimeRequest(), isObservable(), and determineFeasibility(). These will calculated total time required to complete request (including overheads), check how many days in the sememster the target is accessible from Keck Observatory, and perform a first order check of the feasibility of the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all Request objects are created and passing formatting tests, instantiate a Program object and give it a list of request objects. **See below for an example.** Then run three final functions: totalProgramTime(), checkAllRequests(), and writeFile(). These compute stats for your program, check formatting again, and then write out your requests to a csv. Note, the totalProgramTime() function in the Program class will not work if you haven't run computeTimeRequest() function in the Request class for each of your requests.\n",

    "**exposure_time** -- (int) The requested exposure time for each observation, in seconds. For convenience, we have included a function, computeKPFExposureTime, to compute an expected exposure time to achieve a desired single measurement RV precision, in m/s, given a target's V_mag and Teff. Running this function is not required for completingthis section. If you are choosing your exposure time based on other requirements, you may simply input the value here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_observations_per_visit** -- (int) The number of observations (exposures) for each visit within a single night. For example, for a triple shot put 3 here.To compute overhead, we add (N_observations_per_visit - 1)x45 secondsto your request. This is to account for readout time. The -1 is to acknowledgeThat the last observation in a series does readout during slew.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_unique_nights_per_semester** -- (int) The number of times to observe (visit) the star within a night. For example, if you want to observe this star once and then again later in the same night separated by X hours, put 2 here.Note, each visit will get N_observations_per_visit worth of exposures.If this value is greater than 1, you will also need to specify an intra_night_cadence.To compute overhead, we add (N_observations_per_visit x 240) seconds to your request. This is to account for average slew and acquisition time between targets, as well asglobal time sinks, like focus and calibrations\n",
    "\n",
    "**intra_night_cadence** -- (float) The time, in hours, that you wish to be the minimum separation between visits in the same night.If N_visits_per_night is equal to 1, then this number should be set to 0.This value may be a float to allow for fractional hour separtions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N_unique_nights** -- (int) The number of unique nights in the semester to observe the star. Each unique night, the star will be observed N_visits_per_night times, with each visit obtaining N_observations_per_visit exposures.Note, historically, KPF is scheduled for community cadence nights on ~100 unique nights.In a given semester, the total number of nights KPF is scheduled is the maximum possible value for N_unique_nights.Once the KPF schedule is announced and programs are allocated time, PI's who have targets with N_unique_nights > unique nights scheduledwill be contacted and advised to ammend their request or accept the limiting maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "**inter_night_cadence** -- (int) The time, in days, that you wish to be the minimum separation between  observations on unique nights.For example, if you wish to observe this target with at least 10 unique days separation between observations, put 10 here. Note these are calendar days, not KPF scheduled days. If no value is specified, the default value is set to 1 day. This means the target can be observed on every possible KPF scheduled night, until its requsted total observations are achieved. If you wish to only get a single observation of a target, set inter_night_cadence equal to 0.\n"
